# Potyogós Amőba – Drop-Tac-Toe

## Description

Drop-Tac-Toe is a C# Windows Forms application that lets two players enjoy a gravity-based variant of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Instead of placing marks freely, players drop their X or O symbols from the top, letting them fall into the lowest available cell in a column. The game ends when the board is full (draw) or when a player connects four identical symbols horizontally or diagonally.

## Features

- Play on customizable board sizes: 10×10, 20×20 or 30×30
- Win detection for 4-in-a-row (horizontal, diagonal)
- Click-based interaction: drop symbols by clicking on a column
- New game initialization with board size selection
- Save and load game state, including board and player timers
- Individual thinking time tracking for each player
- Pause and resume gameplay
- Victory display with highlighted winning sequence
